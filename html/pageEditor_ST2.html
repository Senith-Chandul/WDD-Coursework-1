      <h2>Template</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Template</b> serves as the foundation for all pages on the
        "Life Below Water" website. It includes a consistent header,
        navigation bar, and footer across all pages, ensuring a cohesive user
        experience. The template is designed to be responsive, accessible, and
        visually appealing, with a focus on reusability and modularity.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The template is built using semantic HTML tags like &lt;header&gt;,
        &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. The navigation bar is
        created using an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) with list items
        (&lt;li&gt;) and anchor tags (&lt;a&gt;) for each page link. The
        footer contains copyright information and links to editor pages.
      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `style.css` file styles the template with a fixed header,
        responsive navigation bar, and a footer that sticks to the bottom of
        the page. Flexbox is used to align the navigation links horizontally,
        and media queries ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
        The header and footer use a dark blue background color with light blue
        text for contrast.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The template ensures consistency across all pages by providing a
        reusable structure for the header, navigation bar, and footer. The
        responsive design ensures the website is accessible on all devices,
        while the modular structure makes it easy to add or modify content.
      </p>

      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>
          &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;: Semantic structure.
        </li>
        <li>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;a&gt;: Navigation bar.</li>
        <li>display: flex;: Horizontal alignment of navigation links.</li>
        <li>position: fixed;: Fixed header.</li>
        <li>
          background-color: var(--very-dark-blue);: Header and footer styling.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring the navigation bar remained responsive on
        smaller screens. This was resolved by using media queries to adjust
        the font size and padding. Another challenge was making the footer
        stick to the bottom of the page, which was achieved using Flexbox and
        min-height properties.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The template follows accessibility best practices by using semantic
        HTML tags and providing clear labels for navigation links. The
        navigation bar is keyboard-friendly, and the footer includes
        descriptive text for screen readers.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>
      <p>
        The template complies with Janet regulations by ensuring proper
        content structuring, clear labeling, and responsive design. It also
        adheres to WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

    <!-- Navigation Bar Section -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Navigation Bar</b> is a key component of the template,
        providing users with easy access to all major pages on the website. It
        is designed to be responsive, accessible, and visually consistent
        across all pages. The navigation bar includes links to the Home,
        Impact Data, Content, and Sitemap pages, as well as other relevant
        sections.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The navigation bar is created using an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;)
        with list items (&lt;li&gt;) and anchor tags (&lt;a&gt;) for each page
        link. The active page is highlighted using a CSS class (`active`), and
        hover effects are applied to enhance interactivity.
      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `style.css` file styles the navigation bar with a dark blue
        background color and light blue text. Flexbox is used to align the
        links horizontally, and hover effects change the text color to bright
        blue. The active page is highlighted with a border-bottom and a
        different text color.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The navigation bar provides a consistent and intuitive way for users
        to navigate the website. The responsive design ensures it works well
        on all devices, while the hover and active states enhance user
        interaction.
      </p>

      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;a&gt;: Navigation bar structure.</li>
        <li>display: flex;: Horizontal alignment of links.</li>
        <li>color: var(--light-blue);: Text color.</li>
        <li>
          border-bottom: 2px solid var(--bright-blue);: Active page indicator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring the navigation bar remained usable on
        smaller screens. This was resolved by using media queries to stack the
        links vertically and adjust the font size. Another challenge was
        implementing the active page indicator, which was achieved using
        JavaScript to dynamically add the `active` class.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The navigation bar follows accessibility best practices by using
        semantic HTML tags and providing clear labels for links. It is
        keyboard-navigable, and the active page is clearly indicated for
        screen readers.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>
      <p>
        The navigation bar complies with Janet regulations by ensuring proper
        content structuring, clear labeling, and responsive design. It also
        adheres to WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Home Page</b> serves as the main landing page for the "Life
        Below Water" initiative. It introduces users to the website's mission
        and provides quick access to key focus areas such as marine pollution,
        coral reef protection, sustainable fishing, and climate impact. The
        page features a hero section with a call-to-action, followed by
        interactive tiles that link to content pages. The design is clean,
        modern, and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across
        devices.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `home.html` page uses semantic HTML tags like &lt;header&gt;,
        &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; to structure the content. The hero
        section is created using a &lt;div&gt; with a background image and
        overlay. The focus areas are displayed using a grid layout with
        &lt;a&gt; tags wrapped around &lt;div&gt; elements for each tile. Each
        tile contains an image and an overlay with text.
      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `style.css` file styles the home page with a responsive grid
        layout for the tiles, hover effects for interactivity, and a fixed
        navigation bar. The hero section uses a linear gradient overlay for
        better text visibility. Flexbox and CSS Grid are used to ensure the
        layout adapts to different screen sizes.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The home page is designed to be visually engaging and user-friendly.
        It provides a clear overview of the website's purpose and directs
        users to explore specific topics. The responsive design ensures
        accessibility on all devices, while the interactive elements encourage
        user engagement.
      </p>

      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>
          &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;: Semantic structure.

        <li>&lt;div&gt;: Container for hero section and tiles.</li>
        <li>display: grid;: Creates a responsive grid layout for tiles.</li>
        <li>
          background-image: linear-gradient();: Adds overlay to the hero
          section.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring the hero section's text remained readable
        across different screen sizes. This was resolved by using a
        combination of responsive font sizes and a gradient overlay. Another
        challenge was creating a seamless transition between the hero section
        and the tiles, which was achieved by adjusting the padding and
        margins.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The home page follows accessibility best practices by using semantic
        HTML tags and providing alt text for images. The navigation bar is
        keyboard-friendly, and the tiles are clearly labeled for screen
        readers.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>
      <p>
        The home page complies with Janet regulations by ensuring proper
        content structuring, clear labeling, and responsive design. It also
        adheres to WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

      <h2>Table Page</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Table Page</b> displays impact data related to marine
        conservation efforts across various countries. It uses a responsive
        table layout to present data on CO₂ emissions, protected areas, and
        conservation status. The table is styled with icons and color-coded
        status indicators to enhance readability and user engagement.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `table.html` page uses the &lt;table&gt; element to structure the
        data. Each row (&lt;tr&gt;) contains cells (&lt;td&gt;) for country
        names, CO₂ emissions, protected areas, and status. Icons are added
        using Font Awesome, and status indicators are styled with &lt;span&gt;
        tags.
      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `table.css` file styles the table with alternating row colors,
        hover effects, and responsive design. The status indicators use
        background colors and border-radius to create a pill-like appearance.
        The table is centered on the page and adapts to different screen
        sizes.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The table page provides a clear and concise way to present complex
        data. The use of icons and color-coded status indicators makes it easy
        for users to quickly understand the information. The responsive design
        ensures the table is accessible on all devices.
      </p>

      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>&lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;: Table structure.</li>
        <li>&lt;span&gt;: Status indicators.</li>
        <li>background-color: rgba();: Alternating row colors.</li>
        <li>border-radius: 15px;: Pill-like status indicators.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring the table remained readable on smaller
        screens. This was resolved by using horizontal scrolling for the table
        and adjusting font sizes. Another challenge was styling the status
        indicators, which was achieved using CSS pseudo-elements.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The table page follows accessibility best practices by using semantic
        HTML tags and providing clear labels for icons and status indicators.
        The table is keyboard-navigable, and the data is presented in a
        logical order.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>
      <p>
        The table page complies with Janet regulations by ensuring proper data
        structuring, clear labeling, and responsive design. It also adheres to
        WCAG guidelines for accessibility.

      <h2>Content Pages</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Content Pages</b> for "Coral Reef Protection" and "Climate
        Impact" were designed to provide detailed information on these
        critical topics. Each page follows a structured layout with sections
        for introduction, importance, threats, conservation/mitigation
        strategies, and ways to support the cause. The pages are visually
        engaging, with images, horizontal navigation bars, and interactive
        elements to enhance user experience.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        Both content pages use semantic HTML tags like &lt;header&gt;,
        &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; to structure the content. The pages
        are divided into sections using &lt;section&gt; tags, each with a
        unique ID for navigation. The horizontal navigation bar is created
        using an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) with anchor tags (&lt;a&gt;) for
        smooth scrolling between sections. Images are displayed using the
        &lt;img&gt; tag, and captions are added using &lt;p&gt; tags.
      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `content.css` file styles the pages with a consistent design. Key
        CSS features include:
      </p>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Full-Width Rectangle</strong> – A container for images at
          the top of the page, styled with `display: flex;` and `gap: 2rem;`
          to create a responsive layout.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horizontal Navigation Bar</strong> – Styled with `display:
          flex;` and `justify-content: space-around;` to align links
          horizontally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Sections</strong> – Each section uses a
          semi-transparent background (`background-color: rgba(5, 25, 35,
          0.8);`) and rounded corners (`border-radius: 10px;`) for a modern
          look.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Image Gallery</strong> – Images in the "Threats" and
          "Conservation/Mitigation" sections are displayed in a grid layout
          using `display: flex;` and `gap: 1rem;`.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Go to Top Button</strong> – A fixed-position button at the
          bottom-right corner allows users to quickly return to the top of the
          page.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The content pages are designed to educate users about coral reef
        protection and climate impact in an engaging and accessible way. The
        structured layout ensures that information is easy to navigate, while
        the use of images and interactive elements enhances user engagement.
        The responsive design ensures the pages work well on all devices.
      </p>

      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>
          &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;img&gt;: Semantic structure and
          content.
        </li>
        <li>
          display: flex;: Used for the image rectangle and horizontal
          navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          background-color: rgba();: Semi-transparent background for content
          sections.
        </li>
        <li>position: fixed;: Used for the "Go to Top" button.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring the images in the full-width rectangle
        remained responsive without losing their aspect ratio. This was
        resolved using the `object-fit: cover;` property. Another challenge
        was implementing the horizontal navigation bar with smooth scrolling,
        which was achieved using anchor links and CSS styling. These
        experiences reinforced the importance of responsive design and
        user-friendly navigation.

      <h2>Sitemap Page</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Sitemap Page</b> provides an overview of the website's
        structure, including links to all major pages and sections. It uses a
        hierarchical layout to display the relationships between different
        pages, making it easy for users to navigate the site.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `sitemap.html` page uses a combination of &lt;div&gt; and
        &lt;a&gt; tags to create a hierarchical layout. Each node represents a
        page or section, and sub-pages are nested within their parent nodes.
        The page also includes links to editor and validation pages.
      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `sitemap.css` file styles the sitemap with a responsive grid
        layout, hover effects for nodes, and a clear visual hierarchy. The
        nodes are styled with background colors, border-radius, and box-shadow
        to create a visually appealing design.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The sitemap page is designed to provide a clear and concise overview
        of the website's structure. The hierarchical layout helps users
        understand the relationships between different pages, while the
        responsive design ensures accessibility on all devices.
      </p>

      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>&lt;div&gt;, &lt;a&gt;: Hierarchical layout.</li>
        <li>display: grid;: Responsive grid layout.</li>
        <li>background-color: rgba();: Node styling.</li>
        <li>box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba();: Visual hierarchy.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring the sitemap remained readable on smaller
        screens. This was resolved by using a responsive grid layout and
        adjusting font sizes. Another challenge was creating a clear visual
        hierarchy, which was achieved using background colors and box-shadow.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The sitemap page follows accessibility best practices by using
        semantic HTML tags and providing clear labels for nodes. The page is
        keyboard-navigable, and the hierarchical layout is clearly labeled for
        screen readers.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>

        The sitemap page complies with Janet regulations by ensuring proper
        content structuring, clear labeling, and responsive design. It also
        adheres to WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
