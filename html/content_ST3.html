      <h2>What is Sustainable Fishing?</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable fishing refers to catching fish in a way that maintains fish populations, protects marine ecosystems, and ensures long-term benefits for both nature and humans. It focuses on balancing environmental, economic, and social needs.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Aspects of Sustainable Fishing:</h3>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>Avoids overfishing by setting catch limits based on scientific research.</li>
        <li>Uses fishing methods that minimize harm to other marine species and habitats.</li>
        <li>Ensures that fish populations can reproduce and sustain themselves for the future.</li>
        <li>Supports fishing communities by promoting fair practices and long-term economic stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Without sustainable fishing, many fish species could decline or even go extinct, disrupting marine food chains and threatening food security.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 2: Why is Sustainable Fishing Important? -->
    <section id="importance" class="content-section">
      <h2>Why is Sustainable Fishing Important?</h2>
      <p>
        Overfishing has led to a significant decline in global fish populations, affecting ecosystems and livelihoods. Sustainable fishing is crucial because:
      </p>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li><strong>Prevents Overfishing</strong> – Maintains healthy fish populations and avoids species extinction.</li>
        <li><strong>Protects Marine Ecosystems</strong> – Reduces damage to coral reefs, seabeds, and other habitats.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports Global Food Security</strong> – Fish is a primary protein source for billions of people worldwide.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensures Economic Stability</strong> – Many coastal communities rely on fishing for their income.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By adopting sustainable fishing methods, we can protect the ocean while ensuring that future generations can continue to benefit from marine resources.
      </p>

    <!-- Content Section 3: Threats to Sustainable Fishing -->
    <section id="threats" class="content-section">
      <h2>Threats to Sustainable Fishing</h2>
      <p>
        Several challenges make it difficult to implement sustainable fishing worldwide.
      </p>
      <h3>Major Threats:</h3>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li><strong>Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing</strong> – Many fisheries operate without proper regulations, leading to excessive catches.</li>
        <li><strong>Destructive Fishing Methods</strong> – Practices like bottom trawling and dynamite fishing destroy marine habitats.</li>
        <li><strong>Bycatch (Unintentional Catching of Non-Target Species)</strong> – Many marine species, such as dolphins, turtles, and sharks, get caught and killed unintentionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Change</strong> – Rising ocean temperatures and acidification affect fish populations and migration patterns.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Addressing these challenges requires global cooperation, strict regulations, and sustainable practices at all levels of the fishing industry.
      </p>

    <section id="practices" class="content-section">
      <h2>Sustainable Fishing Practices</h2>
      <p>
        To protect marine life, governments, organizations, and fishing communities are promoting various sustainable fishing methods.
      </p>
      <h3>Effective Sustainable Fishing Practices:</h3>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li><strong>Catch Limits and Quotas</strong> – Governments set fishing limits to prevent overfishing and allow fish populations to recover.</li>
        <li><strong>Selective Fishing Gear</strong> – Using hooks, traps, or nets designed to catch only target species, reducing bycatch.</li>
        <li><strong>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)</strong> – Designating regions where fishing is restricted to allow marine life to regenerate.</li>
        <li><strong>Aquaculture (Sustainable Fish Farming)</strong> – Raising fish in controlled environments to reduce pressure on wild fish stocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-Certifications and Consumer Awareness</strong> – Labels like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) help consumers choose sustainably sourced seafood.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="support" class="content-section">
      <h2>How Can We Support Sustainable Fishing?</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone can contribute to protecting marine life by making responsible choices.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways to Help:</h3>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>Choose seafood certified by sustainable fisheries (e.g., MSC, ASC labels).</li>
        <li>Support local and small-scale fisheries that use eco-friendly methods.</li>
        <li>Reduce seafood waste by consuming fish responsibly.</li>
        <li>Advocate for policies that promote sustainable fishing practices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By making informed choices, we can help ensure that fishing remains a source of food, income, and biodiversity without harming the ocean’s balance.
