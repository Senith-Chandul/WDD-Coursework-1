      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Feedback Page</b> is designed to collect user opinions and suggestions to improve the "Beneath the Waves"
        website. It features a user-friendly form with fields for personal details, feedback, and ratings, including
        interactive elements like emoji ratings and dropdown menus. Built with <b>HTML</b> for structure and <b>CSS</b>
        for styling, the page ensures accessibility and responsiveness, making it easy for users to share their thoughts
        and help enhance the platform.
      </p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `feedback.html` page is structured using semantic HTML tags to ensure clarity and accessibility. The
        &lt;form&gt; element is used to create a feedback form, with &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; tags to group
        related form fields and provide context. Input fields such as &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, and
        &lt;select&gt; are used to collect user data. The &lt;label&gt; tags are associated with each input for better
        accessibility. The form includes various input types like text, email, tel, date, and file, along with radio
        buttons and checkboxes for multiple-choice questions. The &lt;span&gt; tags are used to display error messages
        for invalid inputs.

      </p>

      <h4>CSS Techniques:</h4>
      <p>
        The `feedback.css` file styles the feedback form to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The
        `.feedback-form` class centers the form and applies a semi-transparent background with rounded corners and a
        shadow effect. The `fieldset` and `legend` elements are styled with borders and colors to differentiate
        sections. Input fields and textareas are styled uniformly with padding, borders, and background colors to
        maintain consistency. The `.radio-group` and `.checkbox-group` classes use Flexbox to align options horizontally
        and vertically, respectively. The `.emoji-rating` class uses Flexbox to display emojis in a row, with hover
        effects to enhance interactivity. Error messages are styled with red borders and text to indicate invalid
        inputs. The `.submit-button` class styles the submit button with a background color transition on hover for a
        smooth visual effect.
      </p>

      <h4>Purpose and Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        The HTML structure ensures the form is accessible and easy to navigate, while the CSS styling enhances the user
        experience with a cohesive design and interactive elements. The use of semantic tags and proper labeling
        improves accessibility, and the styling choices create a modern, engaging interface that encourages user
        interaction.
      </p>


      <h4>Key HTML Tags and CSS Properties:</h4>
      <h5>1. HTML Tags </h5>

      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>&lt;form&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;: Form structure and grouping.</li>
        <li>&lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, &lt;select&gt;: Form inputs.</li>
        <li>&lt;label&gt;: Labels for form fields.</li>
        <li>&lt;span&gt;: Emojis for rating.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>2. CSS Properties: </h5>

      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>display: flex;: Aligns radio buttons, checkboxes, and emojis.</li>
        <li>background-color: rgba();: Semi-transparent background for the form.</li>
        <li>border-radius: 10px;: Rounded corners for form sections. </li>
        <li>transform: scale();: Hover effects for emojis.</li>
        <li>transition: background-color 0.3s ease;: Smooth hover effect for buttons.</li>


      </ul>
      <hr>

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        During the implementation of the feedback form, one challenge was ensuring proper form validation to prevent
        incomplete submissions. This was addressed using JavaScript validation, which highlights missing fields and
        provides alerts. Another challenge was improving accessibility, which was resolved by adding &lt;label&gt; tags
        for all input fields. These experiences reinforced the importance of user-friendly and error-proof form design.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The feedback page follows accessibility best practices by using semantic HTML elements like &lt;fieldset&gt;,
        &lt;legend&gt;, and &lt;label&gt; to improve screen reader compatibility. The form includes required attributes
        to ensure users complete necessary fields, and radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns are clearly labeled for
        ease of navigation. Additionally, contrast and spacing considerations help users with visual impairments.

      </p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>
      <p>
        The page aligns with web accessibility and usability standards by following Janet regulations for web
        publication. It ensures proper structuring of content, clear labeling of form fields, and the use of valid HTML5
        elements. Input validation prevents incorrect data submissions, and privacy considerations are maintained by
        keeping user data collection minimal and relevant.

      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>Team Page</b> showcases the members of the "Beneath the Waves" initiative, highlighting their roles and
        contributions to the project. Each team member is presented in a visually appealing card layout, featuring their
        photo, name, role, and a brief description of the pages they designed and implemented. The page uses a
        responsive grid layout to ensure it looks great on all devices, with hover effects that add interactivity. The
        design is clean and modern, with a focus on accessibility and user engagement, making it easy for visitors to
        learn about the team and navigate to individual editor pages for more details.

      <h3>Technical Description</h3>
      <h4>HTML Techniques:</h4>
      <h5>1. Semantic Structure: <h5>

          <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>The page uses semantic HTML tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; to structure the
              content logically. This improves accessibility and SEO.</li>
            <li>The &lt;nav&gt; element is used for the navigation bar, which contains links to other pages on the
              website.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>2. Grid Layout for Team Members: <h5>

              <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>The team members are displayed in a grid layout using the &lt;div class="team-members"&gt;
                  container. Each team member is represented by an &lt;a&gt; tag, which links to their respective
                  editor's page.</li>
                <li>The grid layout is achieved using CSS Grid (display: grid;), which allows for responsive and
                  flexible positioning of team members.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Image Backgrounds: <h5>

                  <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Each team member's image is set as a background image using inline CSS (style="background-image:
                      url('../assets/member3.jpg');"). This allows for easy customization and ensures the images are
                      responsive.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>4. Accessibility: <h5>

                      <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>The &lt;a&gt; tags for team members include descriptive text (name, role, and
                          responsibilities) to ensure screen readers can interpret the content correctly.</li>
                        <li>The alt attribute is not used here since the images are background images, but the text
                          content inside the &lt;a&gt; tags provides sufficient context.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h4>Css Techniques:</h4>
                      <h5>1. Responsive Grid Layout: <h5>

                          <ul class="styled-list">
                            <li>The .team-members class uses grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px,
                              1fr)); to create a responsive grid. This ensures that the team members are displayed in a
                              flexible layout that adjusts based on the screen size.</li>
                            <li>The gap: 2rem; property adds spacing between grid items, improving readability and
                              visual appeal.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <h5>2. Hover Effects: <h5>

                              <ul class="styled-list">
                                <li>The .team-member:hover class applies a transform (transform: translateY(-10px);) and
                                  changes the background color (background-color: var(--bright-blue);) when a user
                                  hovers over a team member. This provides visual feedback and enhances interactivity.
                                </li>
                              </ul>

                              <h5>3. Image Styling: <h5>

                                  <ul class="styled-list">
                                    <li>The .member-image class sets the height of the image container to 400px and uses
                                      background-size: cover; and background-position: center; to ensure the images are
                                      displayed correctly and maintain their aspect ratio.</li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <h5>4. Typography and Colors: <h5>

                                      <ul class="styled-list">
                                        <li>The .team-member h3 and .team-member p classes are used to style the text
                                          inside each team member card. The color property is used to ensure the text
                                          contrasts well with the background.</li>
                                        <li>The #role selector is used to style the role description with a larger font
                                          size (font-size: 1.1rem;) and bold text (font-weight: 600;).</li>
                                      </ul>

                                      <h5>5. Box Shadows and Borders: <h5>

                                          <ul class="styled-list">
                                            <li>The .team-member class uses box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); to
                                              add a subtle shadow effect, giving the cards a raised appearance.</li>
                                            <li>The border-radius: 10px; property rounds the corners of the team member
                                              cards, making them visually appealing.</li>
                                          </ul>

                                          <p>
                                            One challenge encountered was ensuring consistent styling across multiple
                                            pages while integrating different designs by team members. This was resolved
                                            by creating a common CSS file (style.css) to standardize fonts, colors, and
                                            layout structure. Additionally, linking separate CSS files (team.css)
                                            allowed for customization without affecting other pages. Another challenge
                                            was maintaining smooth navigation, which was addressed by implementing a
                                            clear and structured navigation bar across all pages.

      <h2>Content Page</h2>
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        The Content Page (Sustainable Fishing) was designed using structured HTML
        and CSS to ensure accessibility and responsiveness. Key elements in HTML
        include semantic tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and
        &lt;footer&gt; to structure the content. The CSS Grid and Flexbox
        techniques were used for layout management, ensuring a visually appealing
        and mobile-friendly design. Navigation bars use unordered lists
        (&lt;ul&gt;) with CSS styling for horizontal menus. Image sections were
        structured using &lt;div&gt; containers with background-image and
        &lt;img&gt; tags for responsive visuals. The "Go to Top" button was
        implemented as an anchor link for smooth navigation.
      </P>

      <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h3>
      <p>
        One challenge was ensuring consistent styling across different pages while
        maintaining unique elements for each. This was resolved by creating
        separate CSS files for each page while keeping common styles in a shared
        style.css. Additionally, handling responsive images was a challenge, but
        using max-width: 100% and object-fit: cover helped maintain proportion.
        The key lesson learned was the importance of modular CSS structuring and
        planning the HTML layout before implementation
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        The pages were built with accessibility in mind, using semantic HTML
        elements (&lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h3&gt;) to help
        screen readers navigate the content. Alt text (alt="") was provided for
        all images to support visually impaired users. Sufficient color contrast
        was used in the text for readability, and the navigation bar follows a
        logical tab order, allowing keyboard navigation.
      </p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Compliance:</h3>
      <p>
        The web pages comply with Janet regulations by ensuring structured HTML,
        ethical content, and accessibility standards. The use of valid HTML5
        elements, clear labeling, and responsive design aligns with best
        practices. There is no misleading information, and all images used are
        relevant and properly sourced.

      <h5>1. Semantic Structure: <h5>

          <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>The page uses semantic HTML tags like 'header', 'main', and 'section' to structure the content
              logically. This improves accessibility and SEO..</li>
            <li>The 'nav' element is used for the navigation bar, which contains links to other pages on the website.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>The user's profile information is displayed using a combination of 'div', 'img', and 'p' tags. The
                  'img' tag is used to display the user's avatar, while 'h2' and 'p' tags are used for the user's name,
                  role, and description.</li>
                <li>The 'ul' and 'li' tags are used to list the user's volunteering activities.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>3. Skills & Goals Section: <h5>

                  <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>The skills and goals are displayed using an unordered list ('ul'), with each skill represented
                      by a 'li' tag. A 'span' element with a progress bar class is used to visually represent the
                      progress of each skill.</li>
                  </ul>

                      <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>The availability calendar is created using a 'table' element, with 'thead' and 'tbody' for
                          structuring the days and times. This provides a clear and organized way to display the user's
                          schedule.</li>

                          <h5>1. Flexbox Layout: <h5>

                              <ul class="styled-list">
                                <li>The .profile-main class uses display: flex; to create a flexible layout for the
                                  profile sections. This ensures that the content is evenly distributed and responsive.
                                </li>
                                <li>The .interest-icons class uses display: flex; and justify-content: center; to align
                                  the interest icons horizontally.</li>

                                  <ul class="styled-list">
                                    <li>The .avatar img class styles the user's avatar with a circular shape
                                      (border-radius: 50%;) and a border (border: 5px solid var(--bright-blue);). This
                                      creates a visually appealing and professional look.</li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <h5>3. Progress Bars: <h5>

                                      <ul class="styled-list">
                                        <li>The .progress-bar class is used to create progress bars for the skills
                                          section. The width property is dynamically set using inline styles
                                          (style="width: 80%;") to represent the progress percentage.</li>
                                        <li>The ::after pseudo-element is used to display the percentage value next to
                                          the progress bar.</li>
                                      </ul>

                                      <h5>4. Table Styling: <h5>

                                          <ul class="styled-list">
                                            <li>The .calendar table class styles the calendar table with borders
                                              (border: 1px solid var(--light-blue);) and padding (padding: 0.5rem;).
                                              This ensures the table is easy to read and visually consistent with the
                                              rest of the page.</li>
                                          </ul>

                                              <ul class="styled-list">
                                                <li>The .contact-me form class uses flex-direction: column; to stack the
                                                  form inputs vertically. The input and textarea elements are styled
                                                  with padding, borders, and background colors to ensure they are
                                                  visually appealing and easy to use.</li>
                                                <li>The button element is styled with a background color transition
                                                  (transition: background-color 0.3s ease;) to provide visual feedback
                                                  when hovered over.</li>
                                              </ul>
